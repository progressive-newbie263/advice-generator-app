# Building advice generator app using React+Vite, Tailwind

API source: https://api.adviceslip.com

live site url: https://progressive-newbie263.github.io/advice-generator-app/

this is my first time working with an API project. It took me a while to get an idea how to do it. I was proper chuffed after finishing it, and i felt that i learnt a lot after doing this project

Fixing svg image was really hard. after fixing up and down for a while, i ended up adding transform translate onto the svg image and somehow it worked.

I would love you to take a look at my code and give me an idea of how to fix it.
Much love!
